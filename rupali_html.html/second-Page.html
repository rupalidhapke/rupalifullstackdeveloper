            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,<br>
            anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance M<br>
            to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule, and to <br>
            later inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. <br>
            The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him<br>
            in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.
